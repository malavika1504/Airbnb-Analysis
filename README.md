# Airbnb-Analysis
## Introduction

The Airbnb Analysis project utilizes MongoDB Atlas and various data analysis tools to explore and visualize Airbnb data. By analyzing pricing trends, availability patterns, and location-based insights, the project aims to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the travel, property management, and tourism industries.

## Project Overview

This project involves retrieving, cleaning, and analyzing Airbnb data using Python scripting and MongoDB Atlas. It includes developing a Streamlit web application for interactive geospatial visualizations and utilizing tools like Power BI or Tableau to create comprehensive dashboards.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting and data analysis.
  
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based database platform for storing and managing Airbnb data securely.
  
- **Streamlit**: Open-source framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
  
- **Power BI or Tableau**: Business intelligence tools for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
  
- **Geospatial Libraries**: Utilized for geospatial data visualization and analysis.



## Objectives

### Establish MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval

- Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and import the Airbnb sample data.
- Retrieve and query data efficiently for analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Address missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
- Prepare the dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

### Develop Interactive Geospatial Visualizations

- Create a Streamlit web application to visualize Airbnb listings on interactive maps.
- Enable users to explore pricing, ratings, and other factors across different locations.

### Price Analysis and Visualization

- Analyze price variations based on location, property type, and seasonal factors.
- Create dynamic plots and charts to highlight pricing trends and outliers.

### Availability Analysis by Season

- Investigate occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year.
- Visualize availability trends using line charts or heatmaps.

### Location-Based Insights

- Extract and visualize data insights for specific regions or neighborhoods.
- Explore differences in pricing and availability across various locations.

### Interactive Visualizations

- Develop features for user-driven exploration and filtering of data.
- Enhance user engagement with interactive elements and customized views.

### Dashboard Creation

- Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.
- Combine visualizations to present key insights derived from the analysis.
